# Claude Conversation Export Parser

A lightweight Python tool that parses **Claude conversation export** files (`.md`) — such as those generated by the **Claude Exporter** Chrome extension — and organizes their contents into structured directories of code, documentation, and artifacts. It automatically extracts embedded scripts, markdown responses, and file metadata, turning your Claude sessions into clean, reusable projects.

---

## About the Exports

This parser is designed to work with markdown exports created using the Chrome extension:

**[Claude Exporter: Save Claude as PDF, MD and more](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/claude-exporter-save-clau/...)**

Export Claude chats to PDF, Markdown, Text, or CSV — free and fully customizable. The extension supports artifacts, reasoning, and advanced outputs. *(Note: this parser is not affiliated with or created by the extension’s developers.)*

---

## Features

Reconstruct your Claude conversations into usable, organized components:

- **Artifacts** — Detects headers like `## src/utils/helpers.py`, extracts embedded code, and writes them to their proper paths.
- **Code Blocks** — Collects standalone snippets with inferred filenames and correct extensions.
- **Responses** — Converts Claude’s prose, commentary, and markdown output into readable `.md` documents.
- **Metadata Extraction** — Captures `Created`, `Updated`, and `Exported` timestamps from the export header.
- **Automatic Structure** — Outputs a clean directory layout (`artifacts/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`) while preserving paths and avoiding overwrites.

## Installation

Clone the repository (no external dependencies required):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude-conversation-parser.git
cd claude-conversation-parser
````

Requires **Python 3.11+**.

---

## Usage

Run the parser directly on your exported Claude markdown file:

```bash
./parse_claude.py my_conversation.md -o output/
```

By default, it exports all content — artifacts, scripts, and markdown responses — into subdirectories under the specified output folder.

### Options

| Flag               | Description                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `-o, --output-dir` | Output directory (default: current directory) |
| `--artifacts-only` | Export only artifacts                         |
| `--scripts-only`   | Export only code blocks                       |
| `--docs-only`      | Export only markdown responses                |

Example:

```bash
./parse_claude.py export.md --scripts-only -o ~/Desktop/output
```

---

## Output Structure

After parsing, your output directory might look like this:

```
output/
├── artifacts/
│   ├── src/
│   │   └── components/
│   │       └── BookCard.tsx
├── scripts/
│   ├── script_1.py
│   ├── script_2.sh
├── docs/
│   ├── project-overview.md
│   └── workflow-notes.md
```

---

## Example

Given an exported Claude conversation containing:

````markdown
## src/app/main.py
```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

# Notes on Refactoring
This module will handle user input and greetings.
````

Running the parser produces:

```
output/
├── artifacts/src/app/main.py
└── docs/notes-on-refactoring.md
```
